# Big Cats Image Classification

A SVM-based classifier using HOG features to classify 10 big cat species.
## This project addresses the challenge of classifying images of 10 wild cat species using traditional computer vision techniques. The goal is to distinguish between species such as lions, tigers, cheetahs, and snow leopards by leveraging Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features for image representation and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The solution emphasizes reproducibility, computational efficiency, and interpretability while avoiding deep learning frameworks.

## Dataset
- Create a `dataset/10_big_cats` folder in your project root.
- Subfolders should be named by species (e.g., `lion`, `tiger`).
- Place corresponding images in their respective folders.
